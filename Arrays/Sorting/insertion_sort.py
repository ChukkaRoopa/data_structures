'''
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct
position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their 
relative order in the sorted output.

Time complexity = O(NÂ²)
